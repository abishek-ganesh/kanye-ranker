# Kanye West Song Ranking App - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create an HTML-based web application that uses an ELO rating system to rank Kanye West songs through pairwise comparisons, ultimately revealing the user's top 10 favorite songs and albums.

## Core Features
1. Pairwise song comparison interface
2. ELO rating system for dynamic ranking
3. Song preview functionality (Spotify/YouTube)
4. Top 10 results visualization
5. Social media export capability
6. Progress tracking and early exit option

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack (Client-Side Only)
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Responsive design with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **Libraries**:
  - html2canvas: For image export functionality
  - Optional: Chart.js for visualizations

### Data Structure

#### Song Database Schema (songs.json)
```json
{
  "songs": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "title": "Through the Wire",
      "album": "The College Dropout",
      "albumId": "tcd",
      "year": 2004,
      "trackNumber": 4,
      "duration": 221,

    }
  ],
  "albums": [
    {
      "id": "tcd",
      "name": "The College Dropout",
      "year": 2004,
      "trackCount": 21,
      "type": "studio"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ELO Rating System Implementation

### Core Algorithm
```javascript
class EloRating {
  constructor(k = 32) {
    this.k = k; // K-factor
  }

  getExpectedScore(ratingA, ratingB) {
    return 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, (ratingB - ratingA) / 400));
  }

  updateRatings(ratingA, ratingB, scoreA) {
    const expectedA = this.getExpectedScore(ratingA, ratingB);
    const expectedB = this.getExpectedScore(ratingB, ratingA);
    
    const newRatingA = ratingA + this.k * (scoreA - expectedA);
    const newRatingB = ratingB + this.k * ((1 - scoreA) - expectedB);
    
    return {
      newRatingA: Math.round(newRatingA),
      newRatingB: Math.round(newRatingB)
    };
  }
}
```

### Smart Pairing Algorithm
- Prioritize songs with similar ratings (within 200 points)
- Ensure variety: Don't repeat same songs too frequently
- Track comparison history to avoid duplicates
- Balance album representation
